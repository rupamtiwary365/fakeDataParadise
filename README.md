## Inspiration 💡
I was learning SQL and every time I had to create a table with several rows of data to practice it.  So I  stumbled upon some websites which generate fake data. And found some drawbacks while using them they were not easy to use, dated UI, and not beginner-friendly. So I decided to create one for myself during Peace Out Hacks Hackathon hosted by MLH.

## What's next for Fake Data Paradise
Few more features I would like to include are -
1.) Get data in different file formats like Excel, JSON, SQL and other known file types.
2.) Get the data through email.
