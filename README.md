## Inspiration 💡
### I was learning SQL and every time I had to create a table with several rows of data to practice it.  So I  stumbled upon some websites which generate fake data. And found some drawbacks while using them they were not easy to use, dated UI, and not beginner-friendly. So I decided to create one for myself during Peace Out Hacks Hackathon hosted by MLH.

## What it does 🧐
### This website generates fake data 📝 ranging from a Persons' personal details 🧍 like name, city, account number to a Vehicle's model 🚗.

## What's next for Fake Data Paradise
### Few more features I would like to include are -
1. Get data in different file formats like Excel, JSON, SQL and other known file types.
2. Get the data through email.
